# Generative AI Use Case: Summarize Dialogue

In this notebook, we do a dialogue summarization task using generative AI. We explore how the input text affects the output of the model, and perform prompt engineering to direct it towards the task we need. By comparing zero shot, one shot, and few shot inferences, we take a first step towards prompt engineering and see how it can enhance the generative output of Large Language Models.
